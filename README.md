## 📄 Description

This repository provides supplementary material to support the main manuscript, including:

- Extended mathematical derivations
- Numerical simulation results
- Figures and visualizations
- Simulink models and supporting scripts

The goal is to provide insight into the theoretical developments and validate the proposed control scheme for multi-rotor systems under disturbances and state constraints.
