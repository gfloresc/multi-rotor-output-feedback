## 📄 Description

This repository provides supplementary material to support the main manuscript, including:

- Extended mathematical derivations
- Numerical simulation results
- Figures and visualizations
- Simulink models and supporting scripts

The goal is to provide insight into the theoretical developments and validate the proposed control scheme for multi-rotor systems under disturbances and state constraints.

## 🧪 Simulations

The simulation files demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller under aggressive disturbances and predefined boundary constraints. Open the `.slx` file in MATLAB/Simulink and run `parameters.m` to initialize the system.
